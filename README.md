# employee-dashboard
I had used columns in analysis such as salary, age, employees performance, departments, attrition etc.

By using every column we can analyise an employee performance of IBM Company. There are total 301 employees working in a company in which 197 employees are active and 104 employees are those who left the company.

The average age of employee in our company is 44. 

Most Attrition count is in production department, most attrition age is 67

Production is the only department having a consistent performance and very well rating by a year.

Mostly employees resign from the company due to getting another position or unhappy.

Absents are mostly done in the January month.

Salary of CEO & Director of Executive Department is high.

Alagbe, Trina is the best employee who works in Production department as a production technician.
